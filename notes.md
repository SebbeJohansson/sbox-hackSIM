### Plans
- Commands
    - ls - Folder contents
    - help - list all commands
- Ports
- Networks - Public & Private
    - Each player gets assigned a number on join (based on their steamid?), and this is the bases of their public IP. Maybe even two parts or three parts? Maybe the end so that its more chance for it to be unique.
    - Private ips on the LAN can be based some how on their steamid too.

##### Commands

### Ideas
- Folders and navigation?
- Scripts/commands that are stored in a specific folder
- Can players code their own scripts?
